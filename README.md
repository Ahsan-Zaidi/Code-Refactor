## Description

🔍Being a web developer means being part of a community. You’ll need a place to share your projects not only if you're applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also so that you can share your work with fellow developers and collaborate on future projects.

I have created a portfolio, using my new React skills to help set you apart from other developers whose portfolios don’t use the latest technologies.
